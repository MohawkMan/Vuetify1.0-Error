    Notes from your TD: Thank you for entering the Men's 63rd Annual Laguna Open June 3 & 4 or the Women's 42nd Annual Laguna
    Open May 6. Tradition runs deep in Laguna Beach. All the great players have played here in Laguna over the years and
    we look forward to continuing to have world-class competition in the world's oldest continuously run men's Open tournament
    and iconic Women's Open. In the Men's Open, check in time is 8:30 on Saturday and 9:00 on Sunday. The top 20 teams overall
    by rating, and the top 4 Laguna teams by rating, are guaranteed a spot in the main draw on Saturday. If you sign up and
    don't make it in, you will receive an email and text by 2:00 on Friday June 2. The CBVA will promptly refund your entry
    fee. We will only notify the teams that don't make it in, but if you have any doubt, send me a text or email by Thursday
    night, June 1. (714) 381-4000 This is a two day, double elimination tournament, match play format. We will be providing
    music, bananas, water, Gatorade and a player's tent for you. If you plan on staying overnight in Laguna, try The Pacific
    Edge Hotel, about 300 yards south of the courts and home of the famous "Deck" bar and Driftwood Restaurant (www.pacificedgehotel.com).
    In the Women's Open on May 6, it's a one day pool play tournament and check in time is 8:30. We are struggling with sand
    erosion, and I might need to make an adjustment from 20 teams to 15, but it that happens, you'll be notified by Friday
    at 2:00. If you don't hear from me, you're in. We'll be providing music, bananas, water, Gatorade and a player's tent.
