juniors tournaments.  The amount of points awarded at each event will be determined by combining our \"Base Point Scale\" with any approved multipliers for the event. Every event will be subject to the \"Team Participation Multiplier\" detailed below.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Points are awarded to 1st through 9th place for each event. All players who finish outside of 9th place will receive 5 points for participating in the event. Points are cumulative and rankings are calculated by the sum of all points earned within the last calendar year.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </v-card>\r\n
